          <h4>About Me</h4><br>
          <p>
            AchievementLog is a work in progress platform that is dedicated for gamers of all ages to keep track of their in-game achievements.
            It allows you to see what items or steps you would need to take to progress in your game. <br><br>
            I hope to one day to improve AchievementLog to its highest potential so it could help casual and completionists to keep track of their progress in a organised way so they could see how far they've come.
            I chose these three games as they're games that I and my friends usually play where we try to keep track of. 
            This is usually by having a notebook, printed out paper from helpful websites and a whiteboard so I found myself wishing that there was a way to make it easier and ta-dah AchievementLog was born!
            <br><br>
            My original wireframe for this website hasn't gone to plan as it would involve a lot of JavaScript and features that I haven't learned to implement.
            I'm hoping in the future to implement these plans to make this website a better place for all.
            Seeing as this is my first website I can't wait to see what's in store for the future and I hope you enjoy it to.
