        <!--Question 1 -->
        <div class="faq-sec">
          <h2 class="faqQu">What is this Website about  </h2>
          <div class="faqAns">

          </div>
        </div>
        <!--Question 2-->
        <div class="faq-sec">
          <h2 class="faqQu">Do you have sources? </h2></button>
          <div class="faqAns">
            <p>My sources all depend on the game my SDV sources come from Steam and the Wiki, Minecraft is from the fandom wiki and Minecraft Wiki, and Littlewood was just form playing the game and steam </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <!--Question 3 -->
        <div class="faq-sec">
          <h2 button class="faqQu">Is it free to use? </h2></button>
          <div class="faqAns">

        <!--Question 4 -->
        <div class="faq-sec">
          <h2 button class="faqQu">Is it a course project? </h2></button>
          <div class="faqAns">
            <p>Yes! Although I had this idea for a long time I never had the time to start coding it so when we were given an assignment to make our own websites I took the opportunity. 
              Sadly I got a fracture on my foot and was out for almost a month so I got a little behind on all of my work.
            </p>

        </div>
        <!--Question 5 -->
        <div class="faq-sec">
          <h2 button class="faqQu">Can I contribute to this website?</h2></button>
          <div class="faqAns">
            <p>Yes of course! My biggest regret is not asking a classmate if they would like to join my project since I quickly realised it's a big task.
              By the time I understood that we had already submitted our first web phase.
            </p>

        <!--Question 6 -->
        <div class="faq-sec">
          <h2 button class="faqQu">Can I suggest new features or games?</h2></button>
          <div class="faqAns">
            <p> This website is created for all gamers so I would love to hear new features or games people would want me to implement!</p>

        <!--Question 8-->
        <div class="faq-sec">
          <h2 button class="faqQu">Will there be new features?</h2></button>
          <div class="faqAns">
            <p>Since I don't have much expereince yet in coding my original idea for this website isn't fully implemented so yes in the future there will be new features such as a circular progress in the main page and of course that mean your achievements and checklists would be given progress bars</p>

        </div>
        <!--Question 9 -->

          <div class="faqAns">
            <p>No as stated above my originial plan isn't implemented one of which was to save data using localstorage. But in the future it shall be if you chose</p>

        <!--Question 10 -->
        <div class="faq-sec">
          <h2 button class="faqQu">Is there a mobile app?</h2></button>
          <div class="faqAns">
            <p>No currently there is no mobile app in development as I do not have the website fully build nor do I know how to turn it into a mobile app. Since I dont have any code that turns the css into mobile version I also recommend when using on phone to use Desktop Site</p>
